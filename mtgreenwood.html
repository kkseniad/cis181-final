    <h2>About Mount Greenwood</h2>
    <p>
      Mount Greenwood, located on Chicago's Far Southwest Side, is a less densely populated neighborhood with a predominantly Irish-Catholic population.
      Known for its large population of city employees, Chicago’s last farm, and numerous cemeteries, it’s more like a suburb inside Chicago.
      It was annexed officially in 1927, but the neighborhood's history goes back far before that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighborhood’s history starts in 1879 when George Waite founded the Mount Greenwood Cemetery.
      This was quickly followed by more cemeteries as the land was used at the time for farming leading it to be nicknamed "Seven Holy Tombs".
      By 1897, Irish and German taverns and restaurants started to appear as the neighborhood began forming.
      The community voted for annexation in 1927 to get sewers, street-lights, waterlines, and public schools. 
      Post-WW2, the neighborhood grew immensely, adding numerous private catholic schools, bars, and an Irish parade for St. Patrick's Day. 
      It also received additional spikes in migration due to white flight following the civil rights movement, as the Irish community consolidated heavily in the neighborhood.
      By 1980, the last farm sold in Mt. Greenwood was converted into an agricultural high school, making it the last active farm inside Chicago's city limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chicago Agricultural High School remains one of the most unique buildings in the neighborhood.
      The wide stretch of farmland and animals in Chicago makes for an interesting sight and a pleasant walk.
      The annual pumpkin smash event is one of many community events held by the school.
    </p>
