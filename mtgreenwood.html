        <h2>About Mount Greenwood</h2>
        <p>
          Mount Greenwood, located on Chicago's Far Southwest Side, is a less
          densely populated neighborhood with a predominantly Irish-Catholic
          population. Known for its large population of city employees,
          Chicago’s last farm, and numerous cemeteries, it’s more like a suburb
          inside Chicago. It was annexed officially in 1927, but the
          neighborhood's history goes back far before that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The neighborhood’s history starts in 1879 when George Waite founded
          the Mount Greenwood Cemetery. This was quickly followed by more
          cemeteries as the land was used at the time for farming leading it to
          be nicknamed "Seven Holy Tombs". By 1897, Irish and German taverns and
          restaurants started to appear as the neighborhood began forming. The
          community voted for annexation in 1927 to get sewers, street-lights,
          waterlines, and public schools. Post-WW2, the neighborhood grew
          immensely, adding numerous private catholic schools, bars, and an
          Irish parade for St. Patrick's Day. It also received additional spikes
          in migration due to white flight following the civil rights movement,
          as the Irish community consolidated heavily in the neighborhood. By
          1980, the last farm sold in Mt. Greenwood was converted into an
          agricultural high school, making it the last active farm inside
          Chicago's city limits.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chicago Agricultural High School remains one of the most unique
          buildings in the neighborhood. The wide stretch of farmland and
          animals in Chicago makes for an interesting sight and a pleasant walk.
          The annual pumpkin smash event is one of many community events held by
          the school.
        </p>
