              <div class="author_description"> I have lived in Chicago since 2015 - another queer Brown southerner fleeing the region.
              I have lived in Rogers Park for all of it. This city's been good to me, and I love talking about it to anyone visiting or 
              family and friends who love me too much to quell my enthusiasm. I also love history, and this city's chock full of it. The 
              shifting demographics of every pocket of Chicago is fascinating and truly still evolving. With that, I knew immediately on
              receiving this CIS 181 assignment I wanted to use this project to discuss my favorite city and my first real home. 
              Thankfully my group members agreed with the concept!</div>

                I started this project as part of the CIS 181 course at Daley College, with the goal of sharing general
                insights into Chicago’s neighborhoods. I’m a web developer focused on front-end technologies like HTML,
                CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I’m expanding into full-stack development with Node.js and Express, along
                with cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.</div>

                While working as a math teacher for elementary students, I realized that the problem-solving and pattern recognition
                skills I enjoyed most in teaching also applied to software development. My curiosity about how technology works and 
                my love for learning new languages—both spoken and programming—led me to enroll in the Software Development program 
                at Truman College. This project was a great experience for me, especially because I focused on Edgewater, 
                the neighborhood I love and live in. I even used my own photos for the Edgewater page, which made the project feel 
                more personal and meaningful. </div>

                I wanted to express my experiences inside my neighborhood throughout this project by sharing some of the things that make it interesting.
                I'm interested in technology, but not sure exactly where I'd best fit in. Currently, I'm using both this class and my internship at IBM to figure out what sparks my interest before graduating from high school.
